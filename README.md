# Weblog Parsing
My repo of simple scripts to aid in weblog analysis

# Files and description
- iis_weblog_ip_parser.bat - Batch file will simply find all unique, external IP addresses connecting to a web server for a given set of IIS logs within a directory.
- weblog_ip_ioc_cmp.bat - Batch file will compare a list of two IP sets stored in two separate text files.
- fireboxlog_country_connection_analysis.bat - Batch file was my rushed attempt to find all ALLOWED connections with specific countries from Watchguard logs. Yes, I could have been more efficient in building this script. Feel free to modify and update.
